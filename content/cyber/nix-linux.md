title = "Nix: Linux"

`s/arch/nixos/g` is the name of the game. Reinstalling and `home-manager switch --flake .` is all that it takes to get back to a working
and comfortable system. My nix config is very much a work in progress, I need to get more familiar with the language, but it doesn't take
much to get an install configured and running. Getting the config manageable and sensible is a different story.

# TODO:
- reinstallation instructions
- rollback instructions
