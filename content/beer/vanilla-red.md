title = "American Red Ale w/ Vanilla #1"
+++

First attempt at my own recipe, it's just going to be a modification of an american red ale with vanilla added in the keg.
- [vanilla in beer](https://learningtohomebrew.com/vanilla-extract-in-beer-homebrew/)

Some modifications to the "Big Basin Amber" in the [How To Brew](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35281173-how-to-brew) book,
the goal being to make a [Vanilla Bitch Slap](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/29162/129139/).

## Notes
- half a whirfloc tablet added at end of boil
- whirlpooled while cooling
- steam condenser is a good addition, have to find the right heater power % though. A lot more boiled away than i anticipated
  - or i could sparge, maybe half a gallon?
- cooling continues to be a pain under 100&deg;F. Racked to fermentor and chilled in freezer for 2 hours before pitching yeast
