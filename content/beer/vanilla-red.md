# Thoughts

[Red X Malt](https://bestmalz.de/en/malts/best-red-x/) might be a good addition, reducing the crystals and adding Red X. Also 
[this](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/1088126/no-crystal-american-red-recipe-kit-5-gal) recipe calls for
2 oz of Pale Chocolate malt. hmmmm.
