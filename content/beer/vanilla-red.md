title = "Vanilla Bitch Slap #1"
+++

First attempt at my own recipe, it's just going to be a modification of an american red ale with vanilla added in the keg.
- [vanilla in beer](https://learningtohomebrew.com/vanilla-extract-in-beer-homebrew/)

Some modifications to the "Big Basin Amber" in the [How To Brew](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35281173-how-to-brew) book:

## Grain bill
| Ingredient    | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| pale ale malt | 11 lb  |
| crystal 40&deg;L malt | 1 lb |
| crystal 80&deg;L malt | 1 lb |

## Hop Schedule
| Hops | Amount | Boil Time |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Nugget 12% AA | 1 oz | 60 min |
| Amarillo 9% AA | 0.5 oz | steep 15 min |
| East Kent Goldings 5% AA | 0.5 oz | steep 15 min |

# Thoughts

[Red X Malt](https://bestmalz.de/en/malts/best-red-x/) might be a good addition, reducing the crystals and adding Red X. Also 
[this](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/1088126/no-crystal-american-red-recipe-kit-5-gal) recipe calls for
2 oz of Pale Chocolate malt. hmmmm.
