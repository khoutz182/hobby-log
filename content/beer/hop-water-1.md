# Notes

## Acids
Used exclusively citric acid and a little lactic acid to bring pH down. Next time use an acid with less bite, maybe any of:
- gluconic acid
- glucono delta-lactone
- phosphoric acidify

## Carbonating
Also even slightly over-carbonating can give you a foamy mess. 8-10ish psi is fine, otherwise CO2 nucleates out immediately when reaching the
tap, even at frozen tempuratures.

CO2 will come out of solution near the tap as it warms up between pours, resulting in a near constant, but manageable, amount of foam on each pour.
No idea what to do about that.
