My set up is cool but never good enough. In terms of making wort, I have:
[brewzilla gen 4, 110V](https://www.morebeer.com/products/gen-4-brewzilla-grain-brewing-system-integrated-pump-includes-wort-chiller-wifi-bluetooth-rapt-35l-925g-110v-1.html)
as well as some accessories like:
- Clean in Place (CIP) spray head
- whirlpool arm
- neoprene jacket
- [wort spreader + aerator](https://www.morebeer.com/products/kegland-sergeant-sparge-head-wort-speader-aerator.html)
- [flexible arm](https://www.morebeer.com/products/stainless-flexi-arm-flexible-recirculation-brewzilla-315-long-12-hex-nut.html)

Apparently clogging is a big issue with these all-in-one systems. My first two brews had a clog in the pump each time. After the first one, i plumbed the tap
to bypass the pump, so i should be able to get wort out no matter what. See [here](https://www.olbryggning.se/media/multicase/documents/manualer/brewzilla%20gen%204/brewzilla%2035l%20gen%204%20instruction%20manual%20eng.pdf) for instructions.
I have been using a grain bag inside of the malt pipe and that seems to be working for me, no clogs since then.

# Fermenting

I use the [fermzilla all-rounder](https://www.morebeer.com/products/fermzilla-rounder-30-pressure-brewing-kit.html) so i can do pressure
fermentation for lagers and such. Pressure transfers are also really nice.

# Kegging
Bottle conditioning, and bottling in general, is for scrubs. Be better. Demand more. Never settle. You'll want to build a keezer.
Its not hard, but i'd take the time to make it somewhat nice, it's worth it.

My general philosophy is that barbs are terrible and should be banned, i don't like latching on to a specific company normally
but the duotight stuff is really good, the lines are small and smooth so foaming is less of an issue, and adjustment later is
much easier than getting out the knife.

# Gas / lines / quick disconnects
[gas manifold](https://www.morebeer.com/products/duotight-draft-regulator-board-gas-manifold-4.html) 
very useful for fine control of many co2 pressures, as well as turning off in case of leaks or whatnot.
i havent had any leaks with mine though so it should be fine for you, but you never know. i ordered the
parts individually since the kit was out of stock when i was working on it

[QD Cap](https://www.morebeer.com/products/carbonation-line-cleaning-ball-lock-cap-plastic.html)
its just good to have extra available so you have one when you need it, i'd recommend at least 2-3 of each color
(the fit is the same i believe, but conventionally the red is for gas and yellow for liquid). The stainless steel
ones may be better, but not by a significant amount i'd say. quantity has a quality all of its own.

[qd cap with flow control](https://www.morebeer.com/products/duotight-flow-control-ball-lock-quick-disconnect-qd-beverage-8-mm.html)
these seem interesting but ive never tried them yet. the thinking being that its better to control the flow closer to the
source rather than just before it gets to the glass

[cleaning kit](https://www.morebeer.com/products/ball-lock-line-cleaning-kit-mini-party-pump.html)
fill a 2l bottle with some sanitizer, and you can easily clean your lines. not the flashiest thing but very useful
for moving small quantities of a liquid

[evabarrier tubing](https://www.morebeer.com/products/eva-barrier-double-wall-tubing-532-4-mm-id-516-8-od-placeholder.html)
just get a fuckload of this. 39ft would be enough to get you started, but over time you'll probably want more so getting 98ft would just make sense

[qd fitting](https://www.morebeer.com/products/duotight-ball-lock-quick-disconnect-qd-beverage-8-mm.html)
having extra of these is handy as well, the kegland all plastic ones are nice since they go with the evabarrier tubing and they're
easier to clean, but the "older school" ones ([here](https://www.morebeer.com/products/cm-becker-ball-lock-disconnect-beverage-flare.html))
feel like they have a better ball-lock mechanism and spring... so either or, i have a mix. as long as you have enough i'd say you're good.

duotight fittings:
- [flare adapter](https://www.morebeer.com/products/duotight-pushin-fitting-8-mm-516-14-flare.html) for the "old school qd fittings", i'd say get as many of these as you have old qd fittings + 2
- [beer thread](https://www.morebeer.com/products/duotight-pushin-fitting-8-mm-516-58-fpt.html) for hooking up your taps to duotight
- [elbow](https://www.morebeer.com/products/duotight-8mm-516-male-elbow.html) i use on the beer thread just so i don't have lines going straight back into my keezer, makes things a little easier to manage

# Faucets:
i have the [intertap](https://www.morebeer.com/products/intertap-beer-faucet-stainless-steel.html) ones, i found on my carbonated
water faucet, it had corroded a bit of the shuttle and was not as smooth of an action, so i ordered a few of the
[nukatap](https://www.morebeer.com/products/nukatap-beer-faucet-stainless-steel.html) ones, i think it has a plastic shuttle
that should hold up a bit better in terms of corrosion at least. but we'll see

faucet adapters are nice, i only have this one right now though:
[qd adapter](https://www.morebeer.com/products/intertap-beer-faucet-parts-ball-lock-spout.html) - depending on how many taps you want to put together,
i used this to clean multiple taps at once, daisy chaing the output of one to the input of another. then i filled a keg with a gallon or two
of sanitizer, and made that the source for the beginning of the chain and hooked the keg up to co2, pushing the sanitizer through multiple taps

# Keg parts
- poppets: [these poppets](https://www.morebeer.com/products/firestone-keg-poppet-ball-lock.html) are trash, if these are what you have
you'll want to switch them out for [universal poppets](https://www.morebeer.com/products/homebrew-keg-poppet-universal.html), much easier
to deal with.
- [keg lube](https://www.morebeer.com/products/cip-film-keg-lube-4-oz.html), for _every_ O-ring in existance that you have that will touch liquid or gas. you don't need much, this will last you 3 lifetimes
- dont know how close your supply store is, if you tend to only have things available online, then having [extra o-rings](https://www.morebeer.com/products/rebuild-kit-corny-kegs.html) won't be a bad idea. many a brew-day emergencies can be saved if you snap an o-ring or something
- i got some deep sockets ([11/16](https://www.morebeer.com/products/deep-socket-body-connects-1116.html) and [7/8](https://www.morebeer.com/products/deep-socket-body-connects-78-12-point.html)) for the kegs. i wouldnt buy the ones here though, you can get them at ace/menards for like a fraction of the cost
- [standard](https://www.morebeer.com/products/ball-lock-bev-keg-post-2-pack-komos.html) [posts](https://www.morebeer.com/products/ball-lock-gas-keg-post-2-pack-komos.html) are always easier to work with if your keg doesn't have them

# cleaning
cleaning is its whole thing. here's what i do:
- i don't think [this](https://www.morebeer.com/products/submersible-pump-800-gph.html) is the pump i have, but it looks close enough. i can't find the cleaning kit i got that it came from, but it has 1/2" female pipe threads.
- i built [this](https://www.morebeer.com/products/blichmann-fermenator-cip-spray-ball-kit.html) by drilling a hole in a keg cap, those things are thick and tough and i had to get a special bit, so i don't think i saved much money. but i just had the [spray ball](https://www.morebeer.com/products/blichmann-universal-cip-spray-ball.html). i also drilled another hole or two to let the cleaner drain out faster so it doesn't pool as much in there
- to get the spray ball further in the keg, i use a [plastic pipe](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/plumbing/pipe-fittings/plastic-fittings/44076) or two that have that same 1/2" thread
- connect them all with maybe some flexible silicon tubing, stand the keg on its handles in a tub, and pump cleaner/sanitizer up through the cap up through the spray ball
